<!-- Path: src\main\java\com\example\demo\controller\HomeController.java -->
@Controller
public class HomeController {
    @Autowired
    private HomeService homeService;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String home(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("data", homeService.getData());
        return "index";
    }
}

<!-- Path: src\main\java\com\example\demo\service\HomeService.java -->
@Service
public class HomeService {
    public List<String> getData() {
        return Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c");
    }
}

In this article, we have seen how to create a Spring Boot application with Thymeleaf and how to display data from the controller to the view. We have also seen how to create a custom layout file and how to include the fragment in the layout file. We have also seen how to create a reusable snippet using the fragment. We have also seen how to create a reusable component using the Thymeleaf.
